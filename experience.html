        <p>My experience at SP has been nothing short of enriching and exciting.
          Although it has only been around 3 months since I started my course, I
          have learnt so many new things. I feel that though the pace is quite fast,
          all the new skills and knowledge that I have learnt keep me on my toes and I
          feel motivated to keep going and learn as much as I can.
